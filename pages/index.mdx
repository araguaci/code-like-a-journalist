# Code Like a Journalist

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nael Shiab. I am a [computational journalist](https://www.naelshiab.com/) based in Montreal.

This website will be a free and open-source online data analysis and visualization course with JavaScript/TypeScript. It will be available in English and French.

It will be tailored for journalists, but I hope anyone interested in answering questions of public interest with data and code will find it helpful.

I'll work on it with the support of [Jean-Hugues Roy](https://github.com/jhroy), journalism professor at UQAM.

If you want to know when I'll start adding lessons, follow me on these platforms:

- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/naelshiab.bsky.social)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NaelShiab)

And add a star on the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/nshiab/code-like-a-journalist) to keep me motivated!
